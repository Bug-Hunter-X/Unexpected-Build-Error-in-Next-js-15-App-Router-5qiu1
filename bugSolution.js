```javascript
// pages/index.js

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my Next.js app</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```
No code change is needed in this example; the issue is to highlight how unhelpful error messages can be in Next.js 15.  The solution would involve debugging and investigating based on the actual error received.
